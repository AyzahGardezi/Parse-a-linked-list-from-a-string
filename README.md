# Parse-a-linked-list-from-a-string
The C++ file in the repository is a solution to a problem I solved on CodeWars when studying a Data Structures and Algorithms course in my undergraduate studies.

The solution my approach of parsing a string to form a linked list, i.e. passing the string in the form: "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> nullptr" will return a linked list.

The problem is available here:
